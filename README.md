# UC Berkeley Math 54, Spring 2020

This is a repository for the course [Math 54: Linear Algebra & Differential Equations](https://math.berkeley.edu/courses/spring-2020-math-54-001-lec) in Spring 2020.

This repository contains most of the information you need for this course (lecture notes, assignments). Course sensitive information (exam, grade distribution etc) will be posted on [bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1488929) (CalNet ID required).

## General information

Please read the [**Course Policy**](others/CoursePolicy.pdf) **VERY CAREFULLY**  

Instructor: Lin Lin. https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/

Lecture: Dwinelle 155  MoWeFr 02:00PM - 02:59PM

Office Hours: Mo 12:30PM-2:00PM Evans 1083 (office hours may change occasionally, so please check this website first before you come to the office hour each time)

**Textbook:** *Linear algebra and differential equations, second custom edition for UC Berkeley*. 

This consists of selected chapters from the two books *Linear algebra and its applications, fourth edition* by David C. Lay, and *Fundamentals of differential equations, eighth edition* by R. Kent Nagle, Edward B. Saff and Arthur David Snider. It is fine to use the latter two books instead of the custom edition.

**GSI office hours (to be added):**

Any student is welcome to attend the office hours of any GSI.

**Piazza page:** General questions about the course and its content, which might be of interest to other students, can be asked on the [piazza page](https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2020/math54001).

## Announcement

- The first discussion session starts on 1/23 (Thursday).
- If you find the final exam conflicts with your schedule, **please immediately switch to one of the other sessions, no later than 1/31/2020 (Friday).**

## Part 1. Linear algebra, first half.

### Lecture 1/22 Wed

Systems of linear equations, row reduction. 1.1, 1.2.

[Alan Edelman's notebook on Machine Learning with Gaussian Elimination](notebooks/Machine-Learning-with-Gaussian-elimination.ipynb)

This course may demonstrate some numerical calculations using `Julia notebooks`. It does not require you to know the language of [Julia](https://julialang.org/). But in case you are curious (I bet you do), [here is some useful information](julia.md).
