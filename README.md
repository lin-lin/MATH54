**Textbook:** *Linear algebra and differential equations, Second Custom Edition for UC Berkeley*.  **ISBN:** 9780137114030

![textbook_1](lectures/assets/textbook_1.png)

The new textbook contains chapters from the 5th and 6th (new to this custom version) editions of Lay, Lay, & McDonald's Linear Algebra and Its Applications and chapters from the 9th edition of Nagle, Saff and Snider's Fundamentals of Differential Equations. The original custom edition only included chapters from the 5th edition of Lay, Lay, & McDonald's Linear Algebra and Its Applications, and chapters from the 9th edition of Nagle, Saff and Snider's Fundamentals of Differential Equations. 

Previous versions of the custom edition, or the separate textbooks as above **may work (I do not have earlier versions of the textbooks with me so I cannot explain the detailed differences), and it is your responsibility to make sure that you are doing the correct problem sets for your homework.**

Now we start to see something cool about linear algebra in real life: 

Read [this article on Word2Vec](https://towardsdatascience.com/word2vec-explained-49c52b4ccb71) if you want to understand how computers can figure out the meaning of  equations like

"King    -    Man    +    Woman    =    Queen"

using linear algebra. If you want to know even more about this, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQwFeIupNP0).
