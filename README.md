**Textbook:** *Linear algebra and differential equations, Second Custom Edition for UC Berkeley*.  **ISBN:** 9780137114030

![textbook_1](lectures/assets/textbook_1.png)

The new textbook contains chapters from the 5th and 6th (new to this custom version) editions of Lay, Lay, & McDonald's Linear Algebra and Its Applications and chapters from the 9th edition of Nagle, Saff and Snider's Fundamentals of Differential Equations. The original custom edition only included chapters from the 5th edition of Lay, Lay, & McDonald's Linear Algebra and Its Applications, and chapters from the 9th edition of Nagle, Saff and Snider's Fundamentals of Differential Equations. 

Previous versions of the custom edition, or the separate textbooks as above **may work (I do not have earlier versions of the textbooks with me so I cannot explain the detailed differences), and it is your responsibility to make sure that you are doing the correct problem sets for your homework.**

"King    -    Man    +    Woman    =    Queen"

[List of topics in Midterm 1 (pdf)](https://math.berkeley.edu/~nikhil/courses/54.s21/mt1syll.pdf) : this is the Study Sheet written by Prof. Nikhil Srivastava. I cannot do a better job than him in terms of summarizing and clarifying the key definitions, theorems, algorithms, and types of problems that you should know. Please read this carefully. (Chapter 3 is not covered in Midterm 1)
