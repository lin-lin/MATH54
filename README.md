**Textbook:** *Linear algebra and differential equations, Second Custom Edition for UC Berkeley*.  **ISBN:** 9780137114030

![textbook_1](lectures/assets/textbook_1.png)

The new textbook contains chapters from the 5th and 6th (new to this custom version) editions of Lay, Lay, & McDonald's Linear Algebra and Its Applications and chapters from the 9th edition of Nagle, Saff and Snider's Fundamentals of Differential Equations. The original custom edition only included chapters from the 5th edition of Lay, Lay, & McDonald's Linear Algebra and Its Applications, and chapters from the 9th edition of Nagle, Saff and Snider's Fundamentals of Differential Equations. 

Previous versions of the custom edition, or the separate textbooks as above **may work (I do not have earlier versions of the textbooks with me so I cannot explain the detailed differences), and it is your responsibility to make sure that you are doing the correct problem sets for your homework.**

If you are taking a makeup final exam (from Professor Paulin's class
last semester), please 1) join gradescope with the course entry code Entry V5W3WB 2) directly come to Pimentel Hall, Room 1 to take the final exam.
Please do not email me asking for the final score. Your final scores will
be directly sent to Professor Paulin at the end of the semester. 

If you need to complete the Math 49 assignment, please 1) join gradescope with the course entry code Entry V5W3WB 2) directly come to Pimentel Hall, Room 1 to take the final exam.  If the Math 49 assignment
says that you only need to finish the differential equation part, then
you only need to work on the questions in the final exam related to
differential equations. Please do not email me asking for the final score. At the end of the semester, you can contact the
Lead GSI Jiahao Yao <jiahaoyao@berkeley.edu> to finish your Math 49
requirement.
